# About me
I like vanilla stats and getting down to fundamentals.  

Chemical engineer by training. Aspiring statistician. Not a coder, except when I want to make something and know a computer is the best way to do it, like this [arduino/raspberrypi temperature logger](github.com/cliffanderson720/temperature) to prove to my wife that getting a garage door would be helpful.
